- This version stores your previous inputs and plays the next color you will add to your existing set of button presses.

EX: 
- Level 1 plays the red button. You are to respond with clicking the red button.
- Level 2 plays the yellow button. You are to respond by clicking the previous red button and then the yellow button.
- This continues for each level and will not play any of the previous colors as you are to memorize your previous button presses.
